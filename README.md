# algorithms_python
This repo is my python code based on the [Algorithms Specialization Series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera by Stanford University. I'm using this 
as practice in going from psudocode into actual code as well as enhance my understanding of algorithms.
